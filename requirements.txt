# --- Core Data Science & Analysis ---
pandas              # The backbone of data analysis (DataFrames)
numpy               # Mathematical operations needed for stats

# --- Data Visualization ---
matplotlib          # Basic plotting
seaborn             # Statistical data visualization (great for heatmaps)
plotly              # Interactive charts (essential for your "Modern Essentials" vs "Living Necessities" graphs)

# --- Natural Language Processing (NLP) ---
# Used for scanning 10-K reports for "Celebration" vs "Depreciation"
spacy               # Industrial-strength NLP (excellent for extracting entities)
nltk                # Natural Language Toolkit (good for basic tokenization and sentiment)
textblob            # A simpler wrapper for sentiment analysis (good for quick prototyping)
scikit-learn        # Machine learning tools (TF-IDF vectorization, if you want to get fancy)

# --- Web Scraping & Data Extraction ---
# Used to get the 10-K filings from the web
requests            # To make network requests to websites
beautifulsoup4      # To parse HTML from websites
lxml                # A fast parser used by BeautifulSoup

pdfplumber          # Best tool for extracting tables from the PDF reports you have (Citi/McKinsey)

# --- Statistics ---
# Used to prove the "Null Hypothesis" and run Regressions
statsmodels         # The gold standard for statistical modeling (Regression, OLS) in Python
scipy               # For scientific computing (T-tests, P-values)

# --- Dashboarding ---
# Used to build your final interactive portfolio piece
streamlit           # Turns your Python scripts into a shareable web app
